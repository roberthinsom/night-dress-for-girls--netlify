            <h2>4. Choosing the Right Size and Fit for a Nighty Dress for Girls</h2>
            <p>Ensuring that the <strong>nighty dress for girls</strong> fits properly is essential for comfort and warmth. Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing the right size and fit:</p>
            
            <h3>Considerations for Fit:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Room to Layer</strong>: If your girl prefers to wear extra layers beneath her nighty, choose a style that’s roomy enough for layering without feeling too tight.</li>
                <li><strong>Loose vs. Fitted</strong>: While comfort is key, avoid selecting a <strong>nighty dress for girls</strong> that’s too loose, as it can lead to discomfort or difficulty sleeping. Look for dresses with elastic waistbands or adjustable straps to ensure a snug fit.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement</strong>: Ensure that the nighty allows for movement. Girls need the freedom to shift comfortably during sleep, so make sure the fabric isn’t too restrictive.</li>

            <h2>5. How to Care for Winter Nighty Dresses for Girls</h2>
            <p>To keep your winter <strong>nighty dress for girls</strong> in top condition, proper care is important. Here are some tips to maintain softness, warmth, and durability:</p>
            
            <h3>5.1 Washing Instructions</h3>
            <p>Always follow the washing instructions on the care label. In general:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine wash flannel and fleece <strong>nighty dresses for girls</strong> in cold water to preserve their softness and prevent shrinking.</li>
                <li>Cotton blends can also be machine washed, but avoid hot water to prevent fading.</li>
                <li>For nighties with delicate details like lace or ruffles, hand wash or use a gentle cycle to avoid damage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5.2 Drying</h3>
            <p>Air-drying is the best option for winter nighties. Avoid high heat in the dryer, as it can cause fabrics to shrink or lose their softness. Lay the nighty flat to dry or hang it up in a well-ventilated area.</p>
            
            <h3>5.3 Storage</h3>
            <p>Store winter <strong>nighty dresses for girls</strong> in a cool, dry place. Avoid hanging them on rough hangers, which can cause fabric snags. Fold the dresses neatly and keep them in a drawer or closet where they won’t be exposed to excess moisture.</p>
